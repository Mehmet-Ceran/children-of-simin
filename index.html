        <p><strong>“From the pen of dear Mehmet Ceran — his debut novel, Children of Simin…”</strong></p>
        <p>
          The atmosphere of the book is striking, and the author tells the story without ever allowing
          your attention to drift. The plot is dense yet gripping; you find yourself thinking as you turn
          the pages, almost as if you were listening to a fairy tale — contemplating how the pressures
          imposed on people can persist across generations…

        <p><strong>“What do you think hope and reason can achieve when they stand together against brute force?”</strong></p>
        <p>
          Their story will stay with me — an inspiring tale of solidarity and resistance against oppression.
          I loved the fluid, compelling writing; I never wanted to put the book down. Its fairytale-like tone
          and the excitement of its unfolding events made it impossible to step away.

        <p><strong>“A miracle within reality…”</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some people see the book in my hands and ask if it is fantasy — it isn’t, but it pulls you
          toward miracles hidden inside reality. Humanity is enchanted by such miracles; this is why
          Marquez calls the movement “magical realism.” Mehmet Ceran believes his story carries that
          fairytale-like truth. 🥰  
          The characters feel as if they were drawn from fairytales, everyday life, novels, masnavis,
          and folk literature all at once.
